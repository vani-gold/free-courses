                <p>Hair importation is a very huge topic because of the diversity in the hair Industries. If you are here to learn hair importation, then you must be lucky because I will show you the A – Z you need to understand this hair importation Business.
                  If you are Male here, after this lesson you will be able to tell which of your wife’s hair is fake and which is original. Lol
                 I know all the ladies in this group know the importance of good hair and also know that good hair can go for as much as 300,000 FRS ($600) and nothing less than 100,000cfa(200$). For example, here in Cameroon, what we see in the market at less than 6000 FRS ($12), is mostly synthetic hair and what we see at 10,000frs($20) to 18000 FRS ($36), is blended hair not human hair.
                 Hair are in different categories and could come from many different countries. 
                 </p>
                 <h3>A short story on how real Human hair is sourced by companies</h3>
                 <p>China and India are the major suppliers of human hair because they have temples where women shave their hair for religious reasons (giving to their god). </p>
                <p>India, most of the human hair is voluntarily sacrificed by women, meanwhile, in china it is a fully fledged business where poor Chinese women in rural areas sell their hair for a fee and hair collectors who act as middlemen in the virgin human hair business collect the hair and sell to hair manufacturing industries. These companies then package them and disinfect them for the market.</p>
                 <!-- <p>Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.</p>
                <p>Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, we’ve since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.</p>
                <p>With Bootstrap 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a migration to Sass and the move to CSS’s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more modern browsers.</p> -->

        <header><h2>Types of Hair</h2></header>
        <p>Hair types can be devided into four parts, namely :-Virgin hair, Remy hair,Blended hair,Synthetic hair </p>
          <article>
          <h3>100% Virgin hair</h3>
            <p>one hundred percent Human hair is hair that has not been chemically processed but has had all its cuticles removed. It also has not been mixed with synthetic hair.</p>
          <h3>Remy hair</h3>  
            <p>This is also human hair with its cuticles intact. However, it has been chemically processed.</p>
          <h3>Blended hair</h3>
            <p>This is a mixture of human hair and synthetic hair to give something that is average and looks great as well. The percentages of this mixture varies based on your order. You can ask for 50% human hair vs % 50% synthetic hair or 90:10 or 80:20. It just depends on you.  The ratio of the human hair versus the synthetic hair will determine the price of the hair you will orders. But just know that this type of hair is cheaper than a 100% human hair. However the hair is also costly than a pure synthetic hair.</p>
          <h3>Synthetic hair</h3>  
            <p>This is also human hair with its cuticles intact. However, it has been chemically processed.</p>
      <h3>Hair Weight</h3>
            <p>Most procured hair come in bundles measured in grams. They can measure from 70g up to 300g. However, the most common hair weight bundles in Cameroon is between 70g to 120g. To increase profit margin, most hair vendors sell 70g hair for the cost of 100g. This is not advisable especially if you are trying to start a new business. Nobody will refer you to others if they think you cheated.
        NB: this does not only applies to hair, it also applies to any thing any you intend to do sell.
        </p>

        <code>
        &lt;div class="container">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
      </pre> -->
     
      <!-- <p>Use <code class="highlight-rouge">.container-fluid</code> for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.</p>  -->

        &lt;div class="container-fluid">...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
      </pre> -->
        
        <h3>Grades of Human Hair</h3>
          <p>Human hair comes in different qualities and grades. These different qualities are call grades. This hair quality (grades) is something that has been evolving over the years just like our Samsung phones for example. At one time, S4. Everyone scrambled to have it and the cost was also high because of this high demand. Now no one will even think of s4 when planning to buy a phone. And as you can notice every new version of phones comes with some added advantages and it’s usually better than the former. This is exactly how it works with hair. The only different is that instead of hair version, we call it hair grades. (Hope you get it?)</p>
        <h3>Grade 6A</h3>
        <p>This was the first hair grade. It is usually of medium thickness. It is mostly straight. It can last up to a year if you take proper care of it.</p>
        <h3>Grade 7A*</h3>
        <p>This followed after the release of grade 6. Grade 6 and 7 had their own strength and weaknesses. Thereafter, they were progressively  upgrade to GRADE 8A, 9A, 10A, 11A and the last time I checked, we were at grade 13A. Grade 12A is nicer than 11A and grade 11A is nicer than 10A. 10A is nicer than 9A. And so on and so forth
          Their prices also increases as the grades increase. Choose what to buy base on the type of clients you have (your market).           </p>
        <p>*NB: China and India are the main countries from which pure Human hair are sourced*</p>
          <h3>Categorizing hair by Country</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, hair can be categorize by countries and that is why you will hear things like India hair, Brazilian hair, Chinese hair, Italian hair and more. But however, you will be surprised to see that all these hair and country names does not really matter. Most sellers just keep using those names because clients are very funny. When a client comes to your shop, you just have to tell them that, you’re having hair from all of those country because they will usually come with premeditated idea on which one is best and as such, you may lose a client for something that does not even exist. Indian hair can be bought from china, Peruvian hair can be supplied from china, and Brazilian is also from china. So all those names is not a representation of where the hair is coming from. Is just there to show the differences and the characteristics of a hair type. It has nothing to do with the country whose name is attached to it. Since I started talking with Hair Company, no hair company has ever ask me whether I want Indian hair or Peruvian hair. But they sometimes ask the grade I want.</p>
          <p> Now a days there is just a lot of mixt-up as far as hair is concerned and 
            Peruvian hair is the most soughed for.
            Note: The hair referred to as Malaysian hair is usually Grade 8A hair.
            Just master the grades and you will become a guru in hair Importation.

        <!-- <p>Several Bootstrap components utilize <code class="highlight-rouge">z-index</code>, the CSS property that helps control layout by providing a third axis to arrange content. We utilize a default z-index scale in Bootstrap that’s been designed to properly layer navigation, tooltips and popovers, modals, and more.</p>
    
        <p>These higher values start at an arbitrary number, high and specific enough to ideally avoid conflicts. We need a standard set of these across our layered components—tooltips, popovers, navbars, dropdowns, modals—so we can be reasonably consistent in the behaviors. There’s no reason we couldn’t have used <code class="highlight-rouge">100+</code> or <code class="highlight-rouge">500+</code>.</p> -->

             <p>Reboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element selectors. Additional styling is done only with classes.

               <li>Avoid <code class="highlight-rouge">margin-top</code>. Vertical margins can collapse, yielding unexpected results. More importantly though, a single direction of <code class="highlight-rouge">margin</code> is a simpler mental model.</li>
               <li>For easier scaling across device sizes, block elements should use <code class="highlight-rouge">rem</code>s for <code class="highlight-rouge">margin</code>s.</li> -->
             </ul>
             
            <h3>Page defaults</h3>
             <p>The <code class="highlight-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code class="highlight-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <code class="highlight-rouge">box-sizing</code> is globally set on every element—including <code class="highlight-rouge">*::before</code> and <code class="highlight-rouge">*::after</code>, to <code class="highlight-rouge">border-box</code>. This ensures that the declared width of element is never exceeded due to padding or border.</li>
              <li>The <code class="highlight-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> also sets a global <code class="highlight-rouge">font-family</code>, <code class="highlight-rouge">line-height</code>, and <code class="highlight-rouge">text-align</code>. This is inherited later by some form elements to prevent font inconsistencies.</li>
              <li>For safety, the <code class="highlight-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> has a declared <code class="highlight-rouge">background-color</code>, defaulting to <code class="highlight-rouge">#fff</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
            
        <h3>Preformatted text</h3>    
             <p>The <code class="highlight-rouge">&lt;pre&gt;</code> element is reset to remove its <code class="highlight-rouge">margin-top</code> and use <code class="highlight-rouge">rem</code> units for its <code class="highlight-rouge">margin-bottom</code>.</p>
              
      <pre>
        <code>
        .example-element {
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    }</code>

            <p>The beauty of real hair wigs is that it can be styled and dyed (colored) to match your specific needs. Blended hair is a mixture of virgin hair and synthetic hair. 
             </p>
             <h3>Easy way to test your hair quality.</h3>
             <ol>
              <li>Smoke Test</li>
                <p>Take a lighter or a match and light the ends of the virgin hair wigs on fire. It will turn to ash and burn white smoke if it is virgin hair. If it turns to a sticky texture that hardens when cool and burns black smoke, it is a low Quality hair.</p>
              <li>Burn Test</li>
                <p>Cut a strand of hair from real hair wigs and burn it. It is not human hair if it melts slowly into a ball, smells like rubber, or produces black smoke. If it catches fire, smells like burning hair, burns easily, and curls into a ball immediately, it is human hair.</p>
