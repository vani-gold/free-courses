            <header><h2>INTRODUCTION TO SKINCARE</h2></header>
              <article>
                <p>WHAT IS SKINCARE?</p>
                <p> Skincare is the range of practices that support 
                    skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They 
                    can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and 
                    appropriate use of emollients.</p>

           <p>Skincare is divided into two:-  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PRO-MIXING and</li>
                    <li>ORGANIC MIXING</li>
                </ul>
                <p>PRO-MIXING</p>
                <p>Promixing is the combination of Organic and Inorganic ingredients to achieve a desired and faster result.

                    This is to say that, these inorganic ingredients are still made of organic ingredients but have been put together in form of serums, oils,milks, creams etc to help facilities a faster and effective result in skin care.
                    
                    They are free of "Hydroquinone", "Mecury" and other harsh ingredients that are harmful to the skin, these ingredients have been tested and trusted by dermatologist.
                    
                    Promixing is for those who want to go fully into the business of skin care, for those who are not new in the business of skin care if u notice sometimes when u make purely organic for ur clients its either it does not work fast or they don't Have patience to wait for their creams to starts working that's because it take time to show and some times does not show at all, 
                    
                    So while promixing may take like 2week or less for result to start showing(depending on skin type) purely Organic may take even 3 months or even more then your clients starts complaining that your cream is fake, so to avoid that we have to advance to Promixing.</p>

           <p>THE FUNCTION OF THE SKIN</p>
           <p>Functions of the skin
            As you can see, there are many different structures within the skin. Together these structures impart many protective properties to the skin that help avoid damage to the body from outside influences. In this way, the skin:
            
            protects the body from water loss and from injury due to bumps, chemicals, sunlight or microorganisms (‘germs’);
            helps to control body temperature;
            is a sensor to inform the brain of changes in the immediate environment; and
            synthesises vitamin D.</p>
           <p>THE SKIN BARRIER</p>
            <p>
                The skin barrier is the outermost layer of your skin's surface, and it consists of cells and lipids (fats). 
                
                Also known as the permeability barrier, moisture barrier, or lipid barrier, the skin barrier is responsible for making sure essential water and electrolytes don't evaporate from skin.</p>
                <p>THE FUNCTION OF THE SKIN BARRIER </p>
                <p>The skin barrier is located in the uppermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC; fig. 1). Its function is to protect the body from excessive transepidermal water loss (TEWL), as well as to prevent the penetration of compounds into the body via the epidermis.F</p>

                <h3>Determine Your Skin Type </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1</li>
                    <p>Wash your face to remove make-up. Wash with a gentle cleanser and pat dry. This cleans away oils and dirt that may have accumulated during your day, giving your skin a fresh start. Do not over wash though.</p>
                    <li>Step 2</li>
                    <p>Wait for 30mins. During this time, your skin should return to its natural state, the characteristics of which will determine your skin type. Act normally and don't touch your face.
                    </p>
                    <li>Step 3</li>
                    <p>Dab your face with a tissue. Pay attention to the 'T-zone'-the area of your forehead and nose.
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <p>Skin falls into four types-
                    Normal;
                    Oily;
                    Dry and 
                    Combination.
                    
                    Normal skin shows neither oil nor flaking skin. It should feel supple and smooth. If you have it, consider yourself lucky.
                    
                    Oily skin is characterized by the grease on the tissue. It is also common for a person with oily skin to have large pores and a shine.
                    
                    Dry skin may feel taut or show flakes of dead skin. It is associated with small pores. Moisturizing is important for this skin type.
                    Combination skin is most common. It exhibits traits of all three of the above skin types. Usually, the skin is oily in the T-zone and normal to dry elsewhere. </p>

                    <h3>KNOWING ALL SKIN TYPES</h3>

                    <p>There are different type of skin,which requires different method of treatment</p>

                    <h3>CAUSES OF BARRIER</h3>

                            <li>Smoothens the lips</li>
                            <li>Acts as a lip tint by giving a bright pink color, if you want the pale pink it’s available as well super effective </li>
                            <li>Visible results within 3 -7 days</li>
                            <li>A lip scrub not only removes dead skin cells and helps exfoliate but it also allows for better penetration of hydrating products,smoothens the lips</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note : in making the lip balm and scrub,be very careful not to add any water AT ALL, the only thing you can add if you feel it is too thick is the flavor that’s like water so it will help , and also for the lip balm it shouldn’t have too much oil, it should look like a cream not oil , follow the measurement I sent. Lip scrub should be used like 4 times a week and be gentle with the lips when scrubbing.</p>

                  <h3>  Simple daily routine that will improve your skin</h3> 
                    <p> Drink more water. Your skin will produce more sebum (oil) if it's dehydrated to keep itself lubricated. 
                     
                        One of the most important things you can do for your skin is to stay healthy. 
                        
                        Your skin is part of you. It can be affected by your environment, products you use, your stress levels, diet, lifestyle choices and more. </p>
                        <p> Exfoliation:</p>
                    <p>  This helps to remove dead skin cells, thus boosting tightness. Once or twice a week depending on skin e.g. some skins are very stubborn and have lot of dead cells which stop creams/soaps to be effective, such skin can exfoliate twice a week. </p>
                     <p>How to exfoliate:</p>
                     <p> Wet the body with water then use your exfoliating scrub in circular motion, concentrating more on dark parts or where you have patches on the skin. </p>
                     <p> Note:</p>
                     <p>For acne/ blemishes face, you can steam (put hot water in a bucket, add disinfectant e.g. dettol and salt ,then hold the water like 10 inches away from your face, covering your head with towel) for like 5 minutes to open the pores before exfoliating.

            <header><h2>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2></header>
              <article>
            <p>Organic soap is a soap that is made with only organic(natural) materials. 
                A lot of the time organic and natural are used interchangeably and, for 
                many, an all-natural soap is a great alternative. But if you want to truly 
                use an environmentally-friendly soap, then organic is the way to go.
                
                African black soap, or Organic black soap (also known by various local 
                names such as sabulun salo, ose-dudu and ncha-nkota), is a kind 
                of soap originating in West Africa. It is made from the ash of natural history
                locally harvested African plants, which gives the soap its characteristic 
                dark colour.
                Black soap has become a popular toiletry product in North America due 
                to its benefits on oily and acne-prone skin. In West Africa, 
                especially African, black soap is often made by women using traditional 
                recipes and is often exported through fair trade groups. 
                The traditional recipe of African black soap is a closely guarded secret 
                that is only known to the families that prepare it. The recipes may differ 
                from region to region. However, they have a few common ingredients. 
                The local tribes of West Africa usually use ingredients like palm oil, 
                coconut oil, raw African shea butter or shea tree bark, cocoa pods, 
                plantain skin, and honey for making this extraordinarily rich soap .</p>
                     <h3>GENERAL BENEFITS OF ORGANIC AFRICAN BLACK SOAP </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>It Helps In Soothing Irritated Skin</li>
                    <p>African black soap can calm down your skin – whether it is excessively 
                        dry or you have eczema and other skin allergies. It helps in clearing and 
                        soothing rashes and itching.</p>
                    <li>It Has Antibacterial Properties:</li>
                    <p> African black soap contains phytochemicals and oils derived from plants. 
                        These components are rich in flavonoids, alkaloids, and other bioactive 
                        compounds that can fight bacterial infections and prevent further 
                        infection.</p>
                    <li>It’s Safe To Use For All Skin Types:</li>
                    <p>Usually, synthetic soaps contain a lot of chemicals and artificial 
                        fragrances that destroy the acid mantle of your skin and cause issues. 
                        African black soap contains plant products and is fragrance-free. This 
                        soap is extremely gentle and helps in balancing your skin’s pH without 
                        stripping it of moisture.</p>
                    <li>It Is A Great Natural Moisturizer For The Skin:</li>
                    <p> As African black soap contains a concoction of various oils, along with 
                        shea butter, it is incredibly hydrating and beneficial for dry and 
                        combination skin types. The butter and oils enrich the skin, lock in 
                        moisture, and keep it plump and hydrated.</p>
                    <li>It Cleanses And Exfoliates the Skin Thoroughly</li>
                    <p> African black soap is rich in vitamin E and other emollients. It exfoliates
                        your skin gently, getting rid of all the dirt and dead skin cells, and 
                        prevents signs of aging. Moreover, it is hypoallergenic and does not 
                        irritate your skin. It can be used for washing your hair as well. This soap 
                        has antiseptic properties that can soothe an itchy scalp.</p>
                    <li>It Fights Acne:</li>
                    <p> African black soap is a boon for oily-skinned people and those who are 
                        prone to acne. It balances the natural oil of your skin and doesn’t let 
                        excess sebum clog your skin pores. It is very effective in controlling the 
                        proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria that cause acne</p>
                        <li>It Prevents Razor Bumps:</li>
                        <p>After you have waxed or shaved, your skin needs proper exfoliation to 
                            prevent the dead skin cells from clogging the pores and causing razor 
                            bumps. Using African black soap can help in preventing the bumps and 
                            infections that result from shaving and waxing your skin</p>
                        <li>It Helps In Reducing Hyperpigmentation</li>
                        <p>Sun damage caused by excessive exposure to UV rays can leave ugly 
                            marks and dark spots on your skin (called hyperpigmentation). African 
                            black soap contains shea butter that protects your skin from sun damage 
                            and minimizes dark spots and hyperpigmentation.</p>
                        <li> It Has Antifungal Properties</li>
                        <p>African black soap is a strong antifungal agent. It is very effective against 
                            several types of fungus, including Candida albicans (a type of yeast) that 
                            causes athlete’s foot, jock itch, and other skin infections.</p>
                        <li>It May Help Reduce Fine Lines:</li>
                        <p> A survey involving a 
                            hundred subjects who use African black soap found that about 4% of 
                            them use it for fine lines and all of them were satisfied with the results.
                           </p>
                            <li>It Is Good For Overall Skin Care</li>
                            <p>The same survey found that 70% of the respondents use African black 
                                soap for overall skincare, and about 56% of them use it on both face and 
                                body. They use it to treat acne, dark spots, razor bumps, eczema, fine 
                                lines. 60% of them were very satisfied and 40% of them were somewhat 
                                satisfied with the results.</p>
