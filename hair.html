              <article>
               <p>If I asked you to make a list of ten highly lucrative business opportunities in Africa, I‚Äôm sure human hair would never cross your mind.
                And that‚Äôs what makes this training quite revealing.
                According to estimates, Africa‚Äôs dry hair market ‚Äî that is, the market for weaves, wigs and hair extensions ‚Äî is currently worth over $6 billion a year and growing quite rapidly.
                And I mean real human hair that was shaved off somebody‚Äôs head, and not the ‚Äòsynthetic‚Äô human hair extensions which are just as heavily demanded.
                As you will see in this training the massive demand for human hair in Africa has made a lot of entrepreneurs and investors very rich.
                And there appears to be good reason for the mind-blowing size of Africa‚Äôs hair market.
                Studies reveal that black women are willing to spend at least double the amount on hair and beauty products than white women.
                On a continent where over 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, the business of beauty, especially hair products, is experiencing a significant boom.
                Every year, the value of trade in shampoos, relaxers and hair lotions in Nigeria, South Africa and Cameroon is over $1.1 billion. This figure does not even include sales in other 40+ Sub-Saharan countries. </p>
            <p>And according to Euro monitor International, the market for liquid haircare products in Africa will continue to grow at a 5 percent rate 
                But I digressü§óü§ó‚Ä¶
                And why are women willing to spend more than $250 (on average) on foreign hair?
                Well, any woman who‚Äôs a fan of hair extensions will likely give you an exact, or varied response along the following lines:
                ‚ÄúHair extensions are the vogue and they make me look great.‚Äù
                ‚ÄúI like to play with different hairstyles. I get bored if I have one style for too long.‚Äù
                ‚ÄúMy natural hair is fragile (breaks easily) and can be hard to deal with. Hair extensions make life easy for me.‚Äù
                To be fair to the ladies, there‚Äôs a raft of evidence that proves that Afro-textured hair is notorious for fragility and coarseness (which can make it difficult to comb).
                However, whether it is right or wrong for African women to ditch their natural hair for foreign hair, is a debate that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this training
                This training is focused, not on the entire beauty industry, but on the multi-billion dollar business of human hair.
                And I mean real human hair that was shaved off somebody‚Äôs head,
                Here we go!

          <h3>History of Hair in Indian</h3>
            <p>India is one of the biggest players in the human hair industry and exports up to $400 million worth of human hair every year.
            With a population of roughly 1.3 billion people, of which just over 600 million are women, India certainly has the capacity to supply human hair at a global level.
            Most of the virgin human hair sourced from India are from rural temples and villages where female Hindu pilgrims often shave their hair as a sacrifice to the gods, or as part of a yearly ritual. Most of these women in rural India have natural, high quality hair that may have never been treated with chemicals.
            </p>
            <p>A young Indian woman having her long natural hair shaved.
                One woman can yield up to 280 grams of hair (about 10 oz). The longer the hair, the higher the price it fetches on the market.
                Before the boom in the human hair trade, shaved hair in the temples were burned or used as stuffing for mattresses. But these days, they are collected, processed and auctioned to the highest bidder.
                Some of the hair is packaged and sent to Africa. But most of it still makes its way to Europe and the USA where the demand for human hair is also very huge.
                But there are two main types of Indian hair that reach Africa. They‚Äôre Remy and non-Remy hair:
                
                Remy hair is usually collected from temples, and is often the highest grade of human hair because it retains its natural look since the hair cuticles face same directions.
                Non-Remy hair, on the other hand, is processed because the cuticles do not face the same direction. So it is usually treated with hydrochloric acid to remove the cuticles, which reduces the quality of hair, before export.
                </p>
          <h3>History of Hair in China</h3>  
             <p>China has the world‚Äôs largest population of 1.4 billion people, of which about 50 percent are women. Like India, China also presents a significant supply pool of human hair for the global market.
                China is a big player in the human hair industry, and exports a huge volume of human hair to Africa every year.
                According to the World Trade Organization, China exported nearly 75 percent of the world‚Äôs ‚Äòbird skin, feathers, artificial flowers and human hair products‚Äô in 2012.
                And it continues to dominate the international trade in human hair.
                But unlike in India where most of the human hair is ‚Äòvoluntarily sacrificed‚Äô by women, in China it‚Äôs a full-fledged business ‚Äì poor Chinese women, usually in rural areas, sell their hair for a fee to hair collectors, who are middlemen in the virgin human hair business.
            </p>
            <p>Because of the growing demand for human hair, the Chinese market now trades in a wide variety of human hair collected from neighboring countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Bhutan.
                But all of this hair is branded on the market as ‚ÄòChinese‚Äô hair.
                The human hair business in China is very vibrant and the biggest buyers from Africa are: Nigerians, Ghanaians, Congolese, South Africans, Angolans, Kenyans and Ugandans.
                But again, like in India, the fast-growing demand for human hair is leading to desperate measures.
                </p>
         <h3>Blended hair</h3>
              <p>This is a mixture of human hair and synthetic hair to give something that is average and looks great as well. The percentages of this mixture varies based on your order. You can ask for 50% human hair vs % 50% synthetic hair or 90:10 or 80:20. It just depends on you.  The ratio of the human hair versus the synthetic hair will determine the price of the hair you will orders. But just know that this type of hair is cheaper than a 100% human hair. However the hair is also costly than a pure synthetic hair.</p>
        <h3>Synthetic hair</h3>  
              <p>This is also human hair with its cuticles intact. However, it has been chemically processed.</p>
        <h3>Hair Weight</h3>
                <p>Most procured hair come in bundles measured in grams. They can measure from 70g up to 300g. However, the most common hair weight bundles in Cameroon is between 70g to 120g. To increase profit margin, most hair vendors sell 70g hair for the cost of 100g. This is not advisable especially if you are trying to start a new business. Nobody will refer you to others if they think you cheated.
                 NB: this does not only applies to hair, it also applies to any thing any you intend to do sell.
            </p>

        <h3>History of the Hair Grading System</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôm sorry to break your heart, but the truth is, a huge percentage of human hair sold in Africa as ‚ÄòBrazilian‚Äô and ‚ÄòPeruvian‚Äô are actually Indian or Chinese hair.
            The Secret of Human Hair Grade You Should Know
            As we all know, hair grade stands for hair quality, the higher grade, the better quality, but what is the difference between hair grades?
            </p>
            <p>The hair weave business has changed dramatically over the past ten years.

                Today, there are so many different types of hair extensions as well as marketing terms to quantify the quality of the hair.
                The (5A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 9A, 10A) grading system was created by manufacturers in China as an easy way to explain to their clients ‚Äúhow good the hair is.‚Äù
                Although, there is a catch.
                Do you remember just five years ago when ‚Äú5A‚Äù hair was so amazing? That might have been back around 2012 ‚Äì 2013.
                But wait! Then there was ‚Äú6A‚Äù hair in 2014. That was then the best hair extensions.
                But wait! Then there was ‚Äú6A‚Äù hair in 2014. That was then the best hair extensions.
                In 2015 we were introduced to ‚Äú7A‚Äù Brazilian hair weave which was considered the new top grade.
                The amazing ‚Äú8A‚Äù virgin hair was then popular in 2016 and now in 2017, the ‚Äú9A‚Äù hair weave is the best.
                Now in 2018, you see people selling 10A hair and I have even seen a few marketing 11A and 12A.
                Do you see the trend here? Every year Chinese hair manufacturers add an additional ‚ÄúA‚Äù to their hair to stay competitive. In reality, it is all just hair extension marketing.

          <article>
          <p>Most of these wholesalers in Indian send goods to Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, and Gabon using big companies like DHL, FedEx and UPS. Usually these big companies are very expensive and very faster as well. So if you need a fast means of delivery you can tell the supplier to go ahead. However if you are like me (buying to resell) then you should choose a less costly shipping means that will facilitate your sales.
            Asides these shipping means, you can use any cargo company around your area that ships from India. Every country has a cargo company. the cargo company are less known because advert is done by words of mouths. These cheaper cargo companies give charges based on the exact location the goods are in India, the type of Product and your shipping method (sea or air). So there‚Äôs no upfront price negotiation till they know what you will be shipping and the weight or size (CBM). Cargo companies are preferable for business goods.
